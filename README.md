Below is a complete design and implementation for the web app called "HabitHero". The app is built with React (using Vite for the frontend), Node.js with Express for the backend, and Supabase for authentication (email/password) and database (PostgreSQL). The app gamifies habit-building for elderly and adults by awarding tokens for completing tasks like daily logins, logging habits (e.g., drinking water, going for a walk), and playing a simple JavaScript game (I've implemented a placeholder memory matching game for now, as the full game is to be designed later).

Key Features:
- User authentication via email/password with Supabase.
- Gamification: Tokens awarded for tasks (daily login: 10 tokens, drink water: 5, walk: 10, play game: 20).
- Streaks: Daily login streaks tracked and displayed.
- Badges: Earned based on streaks (e.g., 7-day streak: "Week Streaker") and tokens (e.g., 100 tokens: "Centurion").
- Milestones: Displayed on profile (e.g., "Reached 100 tokens", "7-day streak achieved").
- Reminders: On the dashboard, users see daily reminders for habits (drink water, walk). Tasks are logged manually by the user.
- Profile page: Shows tokens, streak, badges, and milestones.
- Simple JS game: A memory matching game (flip cards to match pairs; completing it awards tokens).

Assumptions:
- Reminders are in-app (shown on dashboard when the app is open). No push notifications (as this is a basic web app; can be added later with service workers).
- The game is a simple React component (memory game with 8 cards). User "completes" it by matching all pairs.
- Tasks are daily; users can complete each once per day.
- Badges and milestones are auto-awarded when conditions are met (checked on task completion).
- Security: Backend uses Supabase service role for admin access. Frontend handles auth, backend handles business logic with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on Supabase tables.
- Deployment: Assume you'll deploy frontend (e.g., Vercel/Netlify), backend (e.g., Render/Heroku), and set up Supabase project.

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase
1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com.
2. Enable email/password auth in Authentication settings.
3. Run the following SQL in Supabase SQL Editor to create tables and enable RLS:

```sql
-- Profiles table (linked to auth.users)
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  tokens INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_login DATE,
  badges TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  milestones TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}'
);

-- Task logs to track completions (prevent duplicates per day)
CREATE TABLE task_logs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  task_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'login', 'drink_water', 'walk', 'game'
  completed_at DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);

-- Unique index to prevent duplicate tasks per day
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_daily_task ON task_logs (user_id, task_type, completed_at);

-- RLS Policies (enable for security)
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

ALTER TABLE task_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own logs" ON task_logs FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own logs" ON task_logs FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Trigger to create profile on user signup
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$  
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id)
  VALUES (NEW.id);
  RETURN NEW;
END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.handle_new_user();

```

### Step 2: Build the Frontend

1. **Set up the frontend project**:
  ```bash
  mkdir habithero-frontend
  cd habithero-frontend
  npm install
  ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
  ```bash
  npm install @supabase/supabase-js react-router-dom
  ```

3. **Run the frontend**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

---

### Step 3: Build the Backend

1. **Set up the backend project**:
  ```bash
  mkdir habithero-backend
  cd habithero-backend
  npm install
  ```

2. **Run the backend**:
  ```bash
  node src/index.js
  ```

---

### Step 4: Connect Frontend and Backend

1. **Start both servers**:
  ```bash
  # Frontend
  cd habithero-frontend
  npm run dev

  # Backend
  cd ../habithero-backend
  node src/index.js
  ```
